# 🛒 Next.js E-Commerce Project Plan (Momen)

## 🧠 Step 1: Plan Before You Code

Before diving into the code, let’s prepare in a smart and structured way:

### ✅ Define the Scope (MVP - Minimum Viable Product)
Basic features to start with:
- Product listing page
- Product details page
- Add to cart
- Checkout (dummy form)
- User authentication (sign up / login)
- Admin dashboard (CRUD for products)

👉 Keep it small first. Add features like payments, filters, reviews later.

## 🧱 Step 2: Choose Your Tech Stack

| Category            | Tool                        |
|---------------------|-----------------------------|
| Styling             | Tailwind CSS                |
| State Management    | React Context / Zustand / Redux Toolkit |
| Authentication      | NextAuth.js or Clerk        |
| Backend             | API Routes (Next.js) or Express/Strapi |
| Database            | PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM     |
| Image Hosting       | Cloudinary or Uploadthing   |
| Payment             | Stripe (optional later)     |
| CMS (Optional)      | Sanity / Contentful         |

## 🗂️ Step 3: Design Mockups
Use **Figma** or even **pen and paper** to design:
- Home page
- Product listing
- Product details
- Cart & Checkout
- Sign in / up
- Admin dashboard

Templates you can use:
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com)
- [Tailwind UI](https://tailwindui.com)
- Free Figma UI kits

## ✅ Step 4: Project Checklist
Create a checklist and tackle one task at a time:

```markdown

## 🧰 Step 5: Prepare Your Tools
Make sure you have the following ready:

- [x] Node.js & npm installed
- [x] VS Code + useful extensions (Prettier, Tailwind, Prisma)
- [x] GitHub repo created
